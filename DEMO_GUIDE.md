## 🎤 Talk Track & Workflow

### 0:00 - 0:15 | The Pitch
- "Welcome to **Task 3**, a high-performance Receipt Analyzer."
- "The goal: Convert chaotic paper receipts into actionable financial intelligence instantly."
- "Tech Highlights: **Next.js**, **Tesseract.js** for client-side OCR, and **Framer Motion** for a premium Dark Neon aesthetic."

### 0:15 - 1:00 | The "Magic" Moment (OCR)
- **Action**: Drag a receipt into the **"Capture Intelligence"** module.
- **Narrative**: "Notice the live progress indicator. We are running a Tesseract AI engine directly in your browser—no data leaves your machine. It's fast, private, and secure."
- **Confirmation**: Wait for the "Capture Successful!" checkmark and point out the entry appearing in the list.

### 1:00 - 1:30 | Visual Analytics
- **Action**: Hover over the **Financial Trajectory** (Area Chart).
- **Narrative**: "As soon as data is captured, our charts re-calculate. The Trajectory chart uses normalized dates to show spending velocity over the last 7 days."
- **Pie Chart**: Point to the **Cluster Allocation**. "We categorize spending automatically into sectors like 'General' or 'Food', helping users spot diversification trends at a glance."

### 1:30 - 1:50 | Resilience & UX
- **Action**: Scroll through the **Recent** list.
- **Narrative**: "The UI is built with a 'Shadow-less' Dark Neon theme. It's designed for low-light environments and high-focus professional use. Every capture preserves the raw text and extracted metadata (Merchant, Total, Date)."

### 1:50 - 2:00 | Wrap Up
- **Action**: Refresh the page.
- **Narrative**: "Final note: All data is persisted locally via `localStorage`. Even after a refresh, your financial dashboard remains intact. Thank you!"
